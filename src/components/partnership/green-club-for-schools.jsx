        We are piloting Green Clubs for Schools to raise a new generation of
        environmental leaders who are equipped with the knowledge and skills to
        address pressing environmental challenges. Partnering with Green Clubs
        for Schools allows us to support these sustainability clubs in secondary
        and tertiary schools to contribute to sustainable practices within
        educational institutions, creating lasting positive impacts on both the
        environment and local communities. Together, we are actualising the
        Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring that today&apos;s students are
        prepared to lead a greener, more sustainable future.
